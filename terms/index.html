        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Last updated August 8th, 2017.</p>
        <p>Here you can find the Terms of Service for Moonlite, the web application from Think Like LLC. Please read these terms of service (“Terms") carefully before using the moonliteapp.com website or Moonlite web application. Throughout this document, we use the terms “Think Like,” "we," "us," and "our" interchangeably to refer to Think Like LLC.</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service (defined below) is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms, as they may be amended from time to time. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, then please exit and do not use the Site or Service.</p>
        <p>We may amend or replace these Terms by posting an amended version on the then current moonliteapp.com website. By continuing to use the website and services following such amendment, you agree to the Terms then posted.</p>

        <h3>1. License to Use the Service</h3>
        <p>Subject to and conditional upon your compliance with these Terms, Think Like provides you with access to our website moonliteapp.com (the “Site”) and grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, right and license (without the right to sublicense) to use certain services and functionality we may make available to you from time to time via the Site or via a related mobile application, including contracting management functionality (the “Service”). You will be and remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of all employees and agents using the Site or Service on your behalf (“Users”).</p>

        <h3>2. Communications</h3>
        <p>By creating a Moonlite user account, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>

        <h3>3. Fees and Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>Your use and authorization to use the Service are subject to timely and complete payment of Think Like fees, which are published on our Site. Think Like may modify the fees associated with the Service at any time. Any fee change will become effective at the time of the change. Think Like will provide you with a reasonable prior notice by email of any change in payment fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your account before such change becomes effective.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the payment fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified payment fee amount.</p>

        <h3>4. Payments</h3>
        <p>A valid bank account is required to process payments made through direct deposit. You shall provide Think Like with accurate and complete payment information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Think Like to charge all fees incurred through your account.</p>
        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Think Like will issue an electronic invoice requiring manual payment by the designated payment deadline.</p>
        <p>Payment processing services for users on Moonlite are provided by Stripe and are subject to the <a href="https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the <a href="https://stripe.com/us/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Terms of Service</a> (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a user on Moonlite, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Moonlite enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Moonlite accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Moonlite to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.</p>

        <h3>5. Refunds</h3>
        <p>Except when required by law, payments of fees are non-refundable.</p>

        <p>You retain any and all of your rights to any User Content you or your Users submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights.</p>

Accordingly, please do not post, upload, submit or share any User Content you wish to be kept confidential or for which you expect compensation by Think Like, acknowledgment or attribution.</p>
