All Services and corresponding deliverables are subject to review and acceptance by Client. In the event any Services and deliverables do not materially conform to this agreement and Client’s reasonable requirements, Contractor will, at Client’s option, either re-perform the Services and deliverables until they are conforming or refund to Client all Fees and expenses previously paid by Client for such Services and deliverables. Neither Party will be liable to the other for failure or delay in the performance of a required obligation, to the extent such failure or delay is caused by an act or omission of the other Party. Each Party will exercise commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to mitigate or limit the delay and resulting damage to the other Party and the overall project.</p>
          <p>If the Parties mutually agree to a change in the scope or nature of Services or deliverables, they may cancel the Project Order and enter into a new project using the Moonlite platform.</p>
