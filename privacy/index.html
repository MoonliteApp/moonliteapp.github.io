        <p>Last updated August 8th, 2017.</p>
        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the mooniteapp.com website or services operated by Think Like LLC (“Think Like”, “Moonlite”, “us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand (i) the types of information we collect at our website <a href="http://www.moonliteapp.com/">www.moonliteapp.com</a> (the “Site”) and the feature and services available via the website or a related mobile application, including our contract management services (the “Service”), (ii) how we use the information that we collect, and (iii) with whom and why we share it. The Site is available for use via a web or mobile browser.</p>
        <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically and will post any changes to the Site so you are always informed about what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose or share it. By continuing to use the Site after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you have accepted the Privacy Policy in its entirety and without modification and consented to our collection, use and sharing of the information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please exit and do not use the Site.</p>

        <h3>1. Information we collect and receive</h3>
        <p><b>We collect different kinds of information</b>. Some of it is personally identifiable and some is not. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:</p>
        <p><b>Personal information</b>. We collect your email address and full name when you authorize your Gmail account via the Gmail API. We do not store access tokens authorized to us by Google if you register via Gmail. We collect your name, email address and other information if and when you voluntarily share it with us using the Service.</p>
        <p><b>Billing information</b>. If you choose to make or receive payment via direct deposit via the Service, our third party payment processors will collect and store your bank account information. At present, our payment processor is Stripe. Moonlite does not store your bank account information.</p>
        <p><b>Log data</b>. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to the Site, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data. Log data does not contain message content and is not routinely deleted.</p>
        <p><b>Device information</b>. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using the Service on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</p>
        <p><b>Service usage information</b>. This is information about which features you interact with within the Site. We don’t log the actual content of the messages, files and comments, just the fact that an event happened using those features on the Site.</p>

        <h3>2. Cookies and other technology</h3>
        <p>We use cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data.</p>
        <p>Some of the information we collect from you at the Site does not personally identify you to us, although it may be unique or consist of information you consider personal. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet Service Provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, the pages you visit and any search terms you enter while on the Site. This information cannot be used to identify you personally unless you identify yourself to us by, for example, making a purchase, creating an account or giving us your e-mail address. If you provide us with personal information by creating an account or otherwise, we may link the information sent to us by your browser to the personal information you have provided to us.</p>
        <p>We use "cookies," “single-pixel gifs,” “web beacons” and other web technologies for a number of purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to collect information about the ways you use the Site — for example, which pages you visit, which links you use, and how long you stay on each page;</li>
          <li>to support the features and functionality of the Site — for example, to save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to the Site; and</li>
          <li>to personalize your experience when you use the Site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. They are unique to your Moonlite account or your browser. Most web browsers accept cookies by default, but you can change your browser settings to refuse cookies. If you do so, you may experience some difficulties with the Site or Service.</p>
        <p>We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser deletes them or until they expire.</p>
        <p>Some cookies are associated with your personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your Moonlite account but are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other similar things.</p>
        <p>Single-pixel gifs or web beacons are tiny graphic images used to help us analyze your patterns of use on the Site, create content designed for your connection speeds, and deliver e-mail in a format you can read.</p>
        <p>We set and access our own cookies on our company-owned domains. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
        <p><b>Third Party Services</b>. We use third-parties for website analytics and other services. Some third-party services we use, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser, which you may be able to opt out of. Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Site, to prepare reports on its activities, and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Please see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ (or any other URL Google may provide from time to time) for information about how Google may use your information and how you may be able to control the information sent to Google.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies, web beacons, and other similar technology, and not the use of such technology by third parties. Similarly, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites accessed via hyperlinks within the Site.</p>
