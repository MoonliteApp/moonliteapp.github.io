        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated February 9th, 2017.</p>

        <p>This privacy policy is here to help you understand what information we collect at Moonlite, how we use it, and what choices you have. When we talk about Moonlite in this policy, we are talking about Think Like LLC, the company and the Moonlite website at moonliteapp.com. Moonlite is available for use via a web or mobile browser.</p>

        <h3>Information we collect and receive</h3>
        <p>We collect different kinds of information. Some of it is personally identifiable and some is non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:</p>
        <p><b>Personal information</b>. Moonlite collects your email address and full name when you authorized your Slack account via the Slack API.</p>
        <p><b>Billing information</b>. If you choose to get paid via direct deposit on the platform, our third party payment processors will collect and store your bank account information. We use Stripe.</p>
        <p><b>Log data</b>. When you use Moonlite, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to Moonlite, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data. Log data does not contain message content and is not routinely deleted.</p>
        <p><b>Device information</b>. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using Moonlite on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</p>
        <p><b>Moonlite usage information</b>. This is information about which features you interact with within Moonlite. We don’t log the actual content of the messages, files and comments, just the fact that an event happened using those features on Moonlite.</p>

        <h3>Cookie policy</h3>
        <p>Moonlite uses cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p>
        <p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer to us, each time you visit our website. They are unique to your Moonlite account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>
        <p>Some cookies are associated with your personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your Moonlite account but are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other similar things.</p>
        <p>Moonlite sets and accesses our own cookies on our company-owned domains. In addition, we use 3rd parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics on their website. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>

        <h3>How we use your information</h3>
        <p>We use your information for the following:</p>
        <p><b>Providing the Moonlite service</b>. We use your information to display your content in Moonlite.</p>
        <p><b>Understanding and improving our products</b>. To make the product better we have to understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it many different ways to improve our products, including research. This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a Moonlite user.</p>
        <p><b>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening</b>. We work hard to keep Moonlite secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.</p>
        <p><b>Solving your problems and responding to your requests</b>. If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.</p>
        <p><b>In-product communications</b>. We may use the information you provide to contact you through in-product messaging tools.</p>
        <p><b>Email messages</b>. We may send you service and administrative emails. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our services, our service offerings and important service related notices, such as changes to this policy or security and fraud notices. These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails to Moonlite users about new product features or other news about Moonlite. You can opt-out of these at any time.</p>

        <h3>Security and third-party services</h3>
        <p>Moonlite doesn’t store your bank account or access tokens authorized to us via Google.</p>
        <!-- Add other third party tools -->

        <h3>Policy</h3>
        <p>This privacy policy may change from time to time, we will notify you.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use the services provided by Moonlite after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
