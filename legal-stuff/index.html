      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <h3>1. Your Acceptance</h3>
        <p>This is an agreement between Think Like LLC, a Maine limited liability company (“Think Like"), the owner and operator the Moonlite software, including Moonlite (collectively, including all content provided by Think Like LLC through Moonlite, the "Moonlite Service", or the "Service"), and you (“you” or “You”), a user of the Service. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND MOONLITE'S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT <a href="#privacy">http://thinklike.co/legal/#privacy</a>, AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you choose to not agree with any of these terms, you may not use the Service.</p>
        <h3>2. Moonlite Service</h3>
        <p>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Moonlite Service. Information provided by our users through the Moonlite Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Moonlite. Moonlite has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Moonlite will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Moonlite shall not be responsible for any damages, claims, or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.</p>
        <h3>3. Moonlite Access</h3>
        <p>A. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, Moonlite hereby grants you permission to use the Service, provided that: (i) your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal use, and you are not permitted to resell or charge others for use of or access to the Service, or in any other manner inconsistent with these Terms of Service; (ii) you will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without Moonlite’s prior written authorization; (iii) you will not attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Service; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>B. In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide Moonlite with your email address. You must notify Moonlite immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Moonlite will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Moonlite or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>
        <p>C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc. or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Moonlite servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a Moonlite application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moonlite grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Moonlite reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Moonlite clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including email address, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.</p>
        <h3>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
        <p>The design of the Moonlite Service along with Moonlite created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like, and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to Moonlite, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. Moonlite reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Service other than expressly permitted herein for any commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>You further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Moonlite all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Moonlite or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.</p>

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
        <p>YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Moonlite SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR USER SUBMISSIONS OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</p>
        <p>The Service is controlled and offered by Moonlite from its facilities in the United States of America. Moonlite makes no representations that the Moonlite Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Moonlite Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p>
        <h3>8. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Moonlite, its parent corporation, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Moonlite Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that the Service caused damage to a third party.

        <h3>9. Ability to Accept Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>You affirm that you are either more than 16 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are at least 16 years old as the Moonlite Service is not intended for children under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Moonlite Service. You further represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a” terrorist-supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

        <h3>10. Assignment</h3>
        <p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Moonlite without restriction.</p>
        <h3>11. General</h3>
        <p>You agree that: (i) the Moonlite Service shall be deemed solely based in Maine; (ii) the Moonlite Service shall be deemed a passive server that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Moonlite, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Maine; and (iii) that you agree to subject to the jurisdiction of Maine in the event of any legal dispute. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Maine, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Moonlite that arises in whole or in part from the Moonlite Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in York County, Maine. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy at http://thinklike.co/legal/#Privacy and any other legal notices published by Moonlite, including, but not limited to an end user license agreement, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Moonlite concerning the Moonlite Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Moonlite’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Moonlite reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, your only recourse is to discontinue the use of the Moonlite Service. Your continued use of the Moonlite Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND MOONLITE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE MOONLITE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

        <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is part of Moonlite’s Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information, obtained by Moonlite, including information obtained when you use the Moonlite Service or any other software provided by Moonlite.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Moonlite does not own or control, or to individuals whom Moonlite does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which Moonlite may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>The Information Moonlite Collects</h3>
        <p>Moonlite may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below (“Personally Identifying Information”):</p>
        <p>User Provided Information: You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your email address, name, address, and bank information (if applicable) to Moonlite when choosing to participate in various uses of the Moonlite Service, such as registering as a user, or updating your account.</p>
        <h3>The Way Moonlite Uses Information</h3>
        <p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Moonlite Site, or Moonlite Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Moonlite Site and Moonlite Service. In particular, your email address is essential to your use of the Moonlite Service and will be retained. Any personal information that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with Moonlite. Any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose on the Moonlite Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the Moonlite Service. We do not use your Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Moonlite Site or Moonlite Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Moonlite Site and Moonlite Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Moonlite Service or Moonlite Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</p>
        <h3>When Moonlite Discloses Information</h3>
        <p>We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the Moonlite Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Moonlite Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. Moonlite also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Moonlite believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Moonlite Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Moonlite, our users or others.</p>
        <h3>Your Choices</h3>
        <p>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Moonlite Site or the Moonlite Service, in which case Moonlite may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account and discontinue use of the Moonlite Service; your continued usage of the Moonlite Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the Moonlite Service. Please contact Moonlite via email to support at moonliteapp.com or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.</p>
        <h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>
        <p>Moonlite is currently ad-free and we hope to keep it that way forever. We have no intention to introduce advertisement into the product, but if we ever do, will update this section.</p>
        <h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>
        <p>Moonlite uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Moonlite and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the Moonlite Service is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, Moonlite makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Moonlite learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Moonlite may post a notice on the Moonlite Site or through the Moonlite Service if a security breach occurs.</p>
        <h3>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h3>
        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Moonlite does not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Moonlite Site or Moonlite Service from persons under 16 years of age, and no part of the Moonlite Service is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use the Moonlite Service or access the Moonlite Site at any time or in any manner. If Moonlite learns that Personally Identifiable Information of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the Moonlite Site or Moonlite Service, then Moonlite may deactivate the account.</p>
        <h3>Special Note to International Users</h3>
        <p>The Moonlite Site and Service are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Moonlite Site and Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Moonlite Site and Service, which are governed by Maine law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by Maine law for these purposes.</p>
        <h3>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>In the event that Moonlite is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
        <h3>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Moonlite Site and Moonlite Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments.</p>
